# Bridges32 - A Method for Segmentation & Measuring of Bridges in Satellite Images using OpenCV

![main image](readme_images/001.png)

# Abstract

Bridge detection in satellite images has strategic significance and practical value in areas such as large-scale infrastructure works, urban planning, transportation networks, and military reconnaissance. However, the arbitrary orientation, extreme aspect ratio proportions and variable backgrounds pose great challenges for their detection.

In this repository, a method for segmentation and measurement of bridges in satellite images is proposed. For this, we attempt to develop functions and algorithms that receives RGB images of multiple resolutions and allow filtering processes that selectively highlight or suppress the information contained in it to perform certain measuring tasks. 

# Introduction

# Proposed Method

1.- Edge detection

2.- Segmentation of the bridge

3.- Extraction of the contour of the bridge

4.- Extraction of geometric properties from the contour

5.- Calculation of measurements
